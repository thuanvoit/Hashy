Experience 1: Performance Measurements:
Collecting and analyzing data on system performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and response time.
Observing how performance varies under different loads or network conditions.

Experience 2: Scalability Analysis:
Testing the system's ability to scale with increasing numbers of nodes or data objects.
Identifying any bottlenecks or limitations that may arise as the system grows.

Experience 3: Fault Tolerance Testing:
Intentionally introducing faults or failures into the system to observe how it responds.
Evaluating the system's resilience to node failures, network partitions, or other disruptions.
